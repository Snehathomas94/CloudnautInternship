Josephus, a Jewish historian living in the 1st century, and his 40 soldiers were
trapped in a cave, the exit of which was blocked by Romans. They chose suicide over
capture and decided that they would form a circle and start killing themselves using
a step of three.

Josephus states that by luck or maybe by the hand of God, he and another man
remained the last and gave up to the Romans. Josephus was a smart person and he
would have been saved because he could compute where he should stand to be the
survivor. As a software engineer, if you were to compute this place where Josephus
should stand, given the group size of N and step on M, how would you do it?


## Solution : Josephus will chose or will stand in  the 31 st position inorder for him to be the survivor.
