Using the basic data structures, design a Cache library, which can be used by other components and applications (similar to any open source library you can
download and use).Cache should be bound in size, and it should be possible to configure the eviction policy Design it in a way that the user of library can
implement his own eviction policy and plug it in.

## Inorder for the Cache library to be used by other components and applications, it should be a DISTRIBUTED CACHE.  

## The data structure we are using here to design the cache library is 
## 1. HASHMAP
## 2. DOUBLY LINKED LIST 

## The Eviction policy we are using here is LRU (LEAST RECENTLY USED) CACHING SCHEME.
